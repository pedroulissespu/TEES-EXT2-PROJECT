## Game Documentation - Code Realms

### üîπ Introduction
- **Game Name:** Code Realms
- **Developer Team:** Fault Finders
- **Description:** The digital world of CodeRealms is in crisis. The main city, Techland, is being consumed by creatures known as ‚ÄúBugs,‚Äù ‚ÄúCode Smells,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHotfix Minions.‚Äù These threats arise from the growing Technical Debt that has been neglected for too long. Now, the systems are on the brink of collapse. You are a young developer known as Alex Byte, recently hired by the legendary coding guild, the Refactorers. Your mission is simple: identify, combat, and eliminate the Technical Debt, restoring stability to CodeRealms.

### üîπ General Settings
- **Resolution:** 640x480
- **Custom Scripts:** No custom scripts were used
- **Plugins Used:** No plugins were used

### üîπ Database
- üìå **Characters** : Alex Byte(Protagonist), Mark Turing(Tech lead), Mentor Linus(Protagonist's mentor), Big Love, Alan Gates, Overlord Legacy(Main antagonist), King(Senior Dev)
- üìå **Items** : No items were used, just the power of refactoring and testing
- üìå **Enemies** : Big Love (At the beginning of the game to teach the protagonist about trials), NullPointer Beasts, Memory Leak Wraith, Hydra and the Overlord Legacy
- üìå **Skills** : Automated testing and stress testing
- üìå **Classes** : Junior Dev, Mid Dev and Senior Dev
- üìå **Weapons & Armors** : Nothing

### üîπ Maps & Events
- üìå **Map List** : Main Base, Base after the conversation, Canyon Database, Forest of Obsolete Frameworks, Castle and Guild
- üìå **Important Events (NPCs, Cutscenes, Bosses)** : Conversation with Tech Lead (Mark Turing), conversation with Mentor Linus, conversation with Big Love, conversation with Alan Gates and the final conversation with Overlord Legacy and his battle

### üîπ Conclusion
It is believed that it is possible, through this game, to have a brief introductory knowledge about what causes, what it is and how to solve technical debt, as technical debt is a very recurring problem in many projects, even renowned projects!

## Special Thanks
Many thanks to everyone who attended Game Day, tested, played and had fun with the game! The game was supposed to be something bigger, addressing technical debt in more detail. However, since the content on technical debt is quite extensive, we compressed the content to something small that is around a 15-20 minute gameplay, but that can go over what technical debt is, how it can impact and how to solve it by mixing it with some RPG aspects, creating through RPG Maker XP. Special thanks also to Professor Ismayle who organized this Game Day day, I hope he uses this project to continue! For other people to try to expand or improve the story, try to address other issues related to technical debt! And also, who knows, try to import everything that was done in RPG Maker XP, to more current versions of RPG Maker and make the game playable in the browser! See you next time, everyone! - Pedro Ulisses 02/24/2025
